# Python List Operations

This script demonstrates basic list operations in Python:

- Creating an empty list
- Appending elements to the list
- Inserting an element at a specific position
- Extending the list with another list
- Removing the last element
- Sorting the list in ascending order
- Finding and printing the index of a specific value (30)


```

The output will display the index of the value 30 in the sorted list.
